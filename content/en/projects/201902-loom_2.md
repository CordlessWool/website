After years of supporting three GhostJS instances for my three blog topics (story, travel, recipes), I have decided to combine them into one GhostJS instance and use one interface. Due to restrictions in GhostJS themes, I have chosen to connect via the GhostJS API and build the frontend in Gridsome.
