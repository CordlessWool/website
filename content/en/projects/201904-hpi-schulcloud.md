As **Software Engineer**, **Scrum Master** and **Architect**, I worked on a **learning platform for schools** that had to scale during COVID-19 from a pilot project to a system serving three German states. In one of the best teams of my career, I helped **stabilise legacy code**, **optimised CI/CD processes** and contributed to **restructuring team organisation**. This project taught me how **genuine teamwork** and **shared responsibility** function even in chaotic situations - the foundation of my current conviction that productive teams emerge through trust and collaboration.

A student prototype became the foundation for a learning platform that suddenly had to be rolled out across three German states during COVID-19. In this chaotic yet educational project, I was able to grow tremendously both technically and as a team member.

## Fullstack Development: Flexible support where needed

**As Software Engineer**, I developed **frontend and backend** according to project needs - React, Node.js, Vue.js. **Additionally, I optimised CI/CD pipelines** and development processes, as our DevOps colleague had more Ops than Dev focus. From local development to deployment, I could contribute everywhere.

## Team Organisation: Bringing structure to chaotic times

When the team grew to over 10 people, we **collectively drove the division into smaller teams**. After reorganisation, we introduced **Scrum processes** - I took over as one of two Scrum Masters leading a team.

**I recognised the need for structured release processes** and raised this issue with the Product Owner. Together we developed a system where teams take rotating responsibility for releases. **In parallel, I improved the Git branch structure** and helped establish clearer development workflows.

## Architecture: Long-term stabilisation

**In the Architecture Chapter**, I worked with 4-5 colleagues on **service separation** and reducing technical debt. Our goal was to gradually split the monolithic system into maintainable services - a process that laid the foundation for later stability.

## Mentoring: Sharing knowledge and strengthening teams

As an experienced developer, I was a **point of contact for junior developers** with technical questions. Finding the balance between support and fostering independence was an important leadership experience.

## The best team of my career

Despite all the chaos, this team was exceptional: **Real collaboration instead of silos** - sometimes backend, sometimes frontend, always in close coordination. **Shared responsibility** in decisions and **room for initiative** even in stressful times.

This experience shaped my understanding of how **productive development teams** function: Not through perfect processes, but through **trust, flexibility and collaborative problem-solving**.

## What this experience demonstrates

**Technical versatility:** Fullstack development from frontend to DevOps, according to project needs

**Team capabilities:** Can work in various roles as well as organise and lead teams

**Pragmatic problem-solving:** Recognise problems early and contribute implementable solutions

**Mentoring competence:** Support other developers in their growth

**Legacy code experience:** Can handle grown, chaotic systems and improve them step by step

This combination of technical skills, team leadership and the ability to remain constructive in difficult situations is the basis for my current conviction: teams need both technical excellence and human collaboration to be successful.
