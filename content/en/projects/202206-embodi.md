embodi is my attempt to reimagine the idea of website builders like _Wix_ in an **open**, **developer-friendly** format. The tool generates **interactive**, fully **static pages** – **modular by design**, easy to customize, and completely **open source**. The goal is to create a system that offers **maximum control** without introducing unnecessary **complexity**.

---

The initial motivation came from a simple request: build a website for a relative. Instead of creating a conventional site, I decided to develop a **flexible builder** where **content** and **components** can be combined independently – without a fixed **backend** and without rigid **tooling constraints**.

Technically, embodi is built on **Svelte** and **Vite**, and generates fully **hydrated single-page applications** from structured content like **Markdown** or **JSON**. The first version was based on **SvelteKit**, but soon hit **limitations**, especially in terms of **user guidance** and **extensibility**. That led to a custom solution with more transparent **build processes** and greater flexibility.

A key focus lies in handling different **contexts** like **development**, **prerendering**, and **runtime**. Each comes with its own challenges – from managing **assets** and **paths** to resolving **metadata** – all of which are explicitly addressed in embodi's **modular** architecture.

This project has given me **deep insights** into **modern build systems** using Vite and strengthened my understanding of **Svelte**, particularly in the areas of **preprocessing**, **component architecture**, and building tools that empower other developers.

embodi is licensed under **Apache 2.0** and is **actively maintained**. The first version is still publicly available under the name [Vally](https://gitlab.com/CordlessWool/vally).
