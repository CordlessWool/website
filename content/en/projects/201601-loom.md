At the age of 15, I began writing short stories on a regular basis. These were initially stored on my personal computer, but following positive feedback from readers, I decided to publish them using GhostJS. Loom was my first custom-developed theme for GhostJS. However, it has not been updated since I began developing a new version based on Gridsome, which utilises the GhostJS API (Loom 2.0). Furthermore, this is no longer being updated and has been replaced.
