Floating Point Units (FPU) are an integral part of any personal computer and most central processing units. The calculation of decimal numbers is a fundamental aspect of any computer, yet it is often taken for granted. For a study project, we implemented an FPU in a Xilinx FPGA and used it with embedded C code.
