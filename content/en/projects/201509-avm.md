At AVM, I worked in the internal IT department, where I was responsible for developing software to improve internal processes. The focus wasn’t on large, flashy systems, but on pragmatic, tailored solutions that made everyday work easier.

My first project was developed in close collaboration with the logistics and sales departments. Based on a specific need, I created an application that automated many manual tasks. From the very beginning, the tool was developed hand in hand with its users — which likely explains why it's still in use today.

In later projects, such as tools for analyzing support requests, I continued to work closely with the teams. Some tools came with a user interface, others ran entirely in the background — but all had one thing in common: they made a noticeable difference.

My approach: listen, understand the core of the problem, and build a solution that simply works.
