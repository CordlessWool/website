In my master’s thesis, I explored how purchasing groups can be digitally secured in a binding way – that is, groups of people who join forces to order products together, often to access better prices or to obtain items that are otherwise unavailable individually.

The core challenge: such communities require trust. What happens if someone suddenly drops out or tries to cover their tracks? To address this, my thesis titled "Blockchain and Related Technologies" examined various technological approaches with the goal of identifying a system in which participants cannot quietly leave or delete data afterward.

To this end, I:

- evaluated existing technologies from the blockchain and cryptocurrency space,
- analyzed key criteria such as scalability, storage requirements, and decentralized distribution,
- developed a conceptual approach for how such groups could be technically secured.

The development of a platform was not part of the thesis – the focus was on evaluating suitable technologies and outlining a potential system design.
