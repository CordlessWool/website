The process of finding a kindergarten place is often complex. I recognized the need for a more streamlined solution and developed a platform to address this. I subsequently discovered that the government of Berlin had implemented a similar initiative. I sought to integrate with this system and engaged with the relevant authorities to gain insight. Due to the restrictions imposed and the requirement that kindergartens in Berlin must use their system, I have ceased investing time in this project. The process of finding and connecting to a kindergarten remains complex.
