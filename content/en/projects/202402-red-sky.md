At **Red Sky**, I supported the introduction of **SvelteKit**. The project originally started as a **migration** of the existing application. However, as the work progressed, **new business requirements** and a strategic **realignment** led to the development of an entirely **new application**.

---

The new software was implemented completely using **SvelteKit** – covering both **frontend** and **backend** functionality. My role involved **technical consulting** as well as **conceptual and architectural implementation**. The work was carried out almost entirely through **pair programming**, following the principles of **Extreme Programming (XP)** – in close collaboration with the **CTO**. I supported the team in getting started with **SvelteKit** and helped translate business concepts into a modular and maintainable codebase.

A particular focus was placed on a **reactive user experience**: user interactions needed to feel immediate, with **data loading seamlessly** and **responsive interfaces**. To improve **real-time communication**, a **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** system was integrated – a somewhat unfamiliar challenge within the **SvelteKit** ecosystem, but one that was successfully solved with the right approach.

The application was launched shortly after the project ended. Internal feedback was consistently positive – especially regarding the **clear code structure** and **readability**, which made further development by the team significantly easier.
