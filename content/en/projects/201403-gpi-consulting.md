After my experience with “Die Kuh bringt's”, I wanted to take a step back from development and focus more on project management. Thanks to the experience I had already gained, I was able to convince GPI to give me this insight through an internship as part of my university studies. As a PMO, I work directly with the project managers.

As a small side project, I was supposed to provide support in controlling. As this was very monotonous work, I converted this task into a development activity and developed a simple CMD script based on C# within 3 days, which took over this activity completely.
