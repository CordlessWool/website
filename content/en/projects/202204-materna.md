As **Technical Project Lead** at **Materna**, I guided the **modernization** of a form for **agricultural subsidy applications** in the **public sector**. I focused on establishing **sustainable structures**, improving **team collaboration**, and aligning **technical and functional goals** across departments. The project reflects **pragmatic renewal**, **clear communication**, and **long-term impact**.

In this project, I was responsible for technically leading the evolution of a complex digital system used in the public sector to manage agricultural subsidies. The goal was to modernize and stabilize an aged platform that had grown over years – without disrupting ongoing operations.

I took over from a seasoned project lead close to retirement.

My approach focused on building long-term maintainability into the project: introducing code reviews, improving communication, and encouraging quality-focused routines – all without leaving anyone behind.

At the same time, I acted as a bridge between technical teams, the client’s management, and domain experts. By translating between tech and business, I helped align expectations and supported the team through to deployment.
