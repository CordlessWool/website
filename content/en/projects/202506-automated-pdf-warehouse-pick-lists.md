On behalf of **HAKRO GmbH**, I developed **automated document generation** for complex pick lists with variable content. The **microservice solution** transforms JSON data into professional PDFs, eliminating manual formatting and reducing operational overhead.

---

## Challenge

Warehouse pick lists require intelligent grouping by location and item number, but content length varies unpredictably. **Document structure directly affects picker productivity** - well-organized, scannable layouts reduce errors and increase throughput. Variable content requires a flexible, automated solution.

## Solution

Developed a microservice that accepts structured data and returns formatted PDFs via simple API integration. The system adapts automatically to content variations while maintaining professional document quality and consistent branding.

## Outcome

**Automated PDF generation** - the system transforms structured data into formatted pick lists. **Professional document quality** through precise recreation of the proven layout with improved structure for optimal readability. **Seamless integration** with existing systems via simple API. **Quality expectations exceeded** - client was impressed with the attention to detail in the digital implementation.

The solution demonstrates how modern web technologies can solve complex business document challenges that traditional tools struggle with.
