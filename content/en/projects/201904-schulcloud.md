In 2020, schools in Germany are mostly analogue, despite the challenges posed by the pandemic. The digitalisation of schools has become more crucial than ever. As a result, the project has transitioned from a pilot phase to a production phase.

The HPI-Schul-Cloud is designed to assist schools in this transition and facilitate collaboration on distance learning. To streamline this process and avoid reinventing the wheel, the project has integrated with other tools to ensure seamless integration. The most significant base is the management of consents and compliance with German law.
