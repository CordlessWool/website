## Once with everything, please!

Not in the mood for technical blah-blah?

Even though I love developing software,
I always look at software from a non-technical perspective.
That means I can look at software from the **user perspective** and **communicate** at this level.

So we talk at eye level while I take care of the technical details.

- No technical blah blah blah
- No worries about availability
- No worries about security
