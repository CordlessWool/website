Poor planning, vague requirements, or miscommunication between tech and management waste **time** and **money**. I help prevent exactly that – with technical **project management** that drives clear decisions, aligns teams, and ensures delivery.

Whether it's launching a new product or streamlining an internal system, my approach combines structure with flexibility to keep projects moving forward without unnecessary overhead.
