# tsup vs Vite/Rollup: Simplicity vs. Flexibility

Vite and Rollup have rightfully become two major players among JavaScript build tools, but sometimes it makes sense to rely on simpler solutions like tsup. Fundamentally, the question isn't which JavaScript bundler is "better" or faster. What's much more important is which one fits your requirements without making the project unnecessarily complex.

In this article, we treat Vite and Rollup as one ecosystem since Vite uses Rollup for production builds and shares its plugin architecture. If you're interested in the specific differences between these tools, we've covered [Vite vs Rollup](https://dropanote.de/en/blog/20250908-vite-vs-rollup-build-tools/) and [Vite vs Webpack](https://dropanote.de/en/blog/20250417-vite-rollup-webpack/) in separate guides.

## Building JavaScript Applications: Vite vs tsup

This is straightforward. The only area where tsup might beat Vite is build time in your CI pipeline, and that's the least important factor.

When building JavaScript applications, Vite offers these benefits over tsup:

- **Dev server with hot reload** - fast building of individual modules while tsup rebuilds everything in watch mode
- **Framework integrations** - React, Next.js, Svelte, SvelteKit, Vue, Nuxt.js
- **Asset handling** - images, CSS, fonts as public assets or transformations via plugins
- **Code splitting** - automatic chunk optimization for applications
- **Plugin ecosystem** - thousands of app-focused plugins

## JavaScript Library Development: tsup vs Rollup

This is where it gets really interesting, as both build tools target the same use case. Let's examine the pros and cons through practical scenarios.

A few years ago, Node.js started transitioning from CommonJS (CJS) to ES modules (ESM) for good reasons. ES modules became the standard in web browsers, but JavaScript and TypeScript libraries written for Node.js wouldn't run in frontend environments - even when they didn't use Node.js-specific functionality. However, the transition is slow, and many existing projects still use CommonJS as the default. To maintain high compatibility with other projects, it's recommended to publish libraries in both formats.

### Batteries already included - keep it simple with tsup

While Rollup allows choosing output formats (CJS, ESM), you need to manage the output stream yourself. tsup makes it easier by sending all formats to a single output directory and handles the rest automatically. No thinking about structure or how to best handle files - simple and straightforward.

```ts title="tsup.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "tsup";

export default defineConfig({
  entry: ["./src/exports/lib.ts"],
  outDir: "dist/lib",
  format: ["cjs", "esm"],
  external: ["valibot", "bson"],
  dts: true,
  clean: true,
  splitting: false,
});
```

Other configurations remain simple too, as they're included directly by tsup. However, tsup is limited to common file formats and languages like `.ts`, `.js`, `.json` and offers no support for formats like Svelte, Vue or Markdown.

_**Notice:** Using Vite doesn't lock you into anything. Libraries can be built with tsup while Vite handles the app. Vite plugins can also be easily bundled with tsup. As often in tech, the world isn't just black and white._

In contrast to tsup, Rollup focuses on its flexibility and plugin system. However, as usual, flexibility comes at the cost of higher complexity.

### Toolbox with many addons - the great freedom with Rollup

Rollup offers an extensive plugin ecosystem that, among other things, enables processing of arbitrary file types. This gives Rollup capabilities that tsup doesn't have, but as already mentioned, more flexibility brings more complexity.

```ts title="rollup.config.js"
import typescript from "rollup-plugin-typescript2";
import { dts } from "rollup-plugin-dts";
import { nodeResolve } from "@rollup/plugin-node-resolve";

export default [
  {
    input: "src/entry.ts", // Entry point
    output: [
      {
        file: "dist/lib.cjs", // CommonJS output
        format: "cjs",
        sourcemap: false,
      },
      {
        file: "dist/lib.js", // ESM output
        format: "esm",
        sourcemap: false,
      },
    ],
    plugins: [
      nodeResolve(), // Resolve node modules
      typescript({ tsconfig: "./tsconfig.json" }), // TypeScript plugin
    ],
    external: [], // Specify external dependencies here, if any
  },
  {
    input: "./dist/entry.d.ts",
    output: {
      file: "./dist/entry.d.cts", // Generate .cts for CommonJS
      format: "es",
    },
    plugins: [dts()],
  },
];
```

Even TypeScript declaration handling requires an extra plugin with its own configuration. This gives Rollup the ability to focus on the core essentials without having to handle special cases like TypeScript separately, but complicates the configuration enormously. Therefore, the recommendation for simple libraries without special requirements remains clearly with tsup.

However, there are cases that tsup cannot handle and where Rollup's flexibility becomes crucial. Showing all possibilities of Rollup would exceed this article's scope, so here are just a few examples:

- Convert Markdown files directly to components for documentation sites
- Automatically transform schemas to TypeScript types during builds
- Create separate versions for Node.js and browser environments
- Inline SVGs as optimized components
- Process environment-specific configurations into constants

## Component Libraries: When Vite Makes Sense

Before we reach the conclusion, let's address one special case where Vite becomes relevant for library development: component libraries.

While you can use tsup or Rollup for component libraries, they differ from functional libraries in an important way. Unlike utility libraries that you can build and test with unit tests alone, component libraries benefit from visual development and hot module reloading for faster iteration. This is where Vite's development ecosystem shines for library projects.

_**Notice:** Even in this scenario, Rollup handles the production build when using Vite._

## When to use tsup, Rollup or Vite

The choice comes down to your specific use case:

**tsup:** Standard JavaScript/TypeScript libraries without special file processing needs. Handles dual ESM/CJS builds with minimal configuration.

**Rollup:** Libraries requiring custom plugins or build-time transformations. Use when you need to process Markdown, custom file types, or multiple output formats.

**Vite:** App development and component libraries that benefit from visual development, hot reloading, and Storybook integration.

### Performance Considerations

While it shouldn't be the main factor, performance often influences tool selection. Rollup will definitely lose the speed race, but it trades speed for the benefit of flexibility. When comparing tsup and Vite, the key question is where speed actually matters. In your CI/CD pipeline, build time differences are usually irrelevant. During development, however, speed becomes crucial. Both tools use esbuild during development, but Vite does partial updates and only rebuilds specific parts. This makes Vite - especially on large projects - significantly faster than rebuilding the whole project on each change.

For production builds, Vite switches to Rollup, making it slower. But how relevant is build time when it runs automatically in your CI/CD pipeline?
