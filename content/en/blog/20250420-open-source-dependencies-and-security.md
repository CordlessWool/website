# More IT Security Through Open Source: Why Businesses Must Invest in Their Dependencies

Modern business infrastructure increasingly relies on open-source software. While many companies recognize the economic benefits of open source, the **security risks tied to open-source dependencies** are often overlooked. In an era of escalating cyber threats and data leaks, the key question becomes: **Can open source offer better security than proprietary software?**

Recent studies – such as the "Census III" report by the Linux Foundation – clearly show that investing in open-source projects not only strengthens IT security but also reduces risk and saves costs in the long term.

## The Invisible Threat in Your Digital Infrastructure

**Most businesses use open source every day – often without knowing it.** From web servers and encryption libraries to container technology, open source is everywhere. It’s flexible, cost-effective, and fast to deploy. But here’s the question few ask: **Who’s responsible for keeping it secure?**

The reality is both surprising and alarming: many of the world’s most critical open-source components are maintained by individuals or small volunteer teams – often with no budget, no audits, and no dedicated security staff.

The **Census III study** revealed just how fragile this situation is: some of the most-used libraries on the internet depend on a single maintainer. A single failure, a **critical vulnerability**, and tens of thousands of systems could be compromised.

**For businesses, this is a risk that's rarely on the radar.** But it should be. Open-source security doesn’t happen by accident. **It requires awareness, participation, and investment.**

## Why Businesses Need to Start Investing in Open Source

Many companies assume they don’t use much open source. In reality, they’re standing on a foundation they don’t even see – and that could collapse with the slightest shake.

**Log4j** was one such shake. A small Java logging library, used by millions, quietly running in the background – until it wasn’t. Suddenly, there was a **critical vulnerability**. Emergency patches, frantic scans, and hasty updates followed. And what did some companies do? They threatened legal action against the maintainers. Against a project they’d never supported, never reviewed, never even acknowledged. Software they had **never invested a single cent in**, but had relied on for years.

This highlights a broader problem: **a deep misunderstanding of how open source works – and what businesses owe to it.**

And Log4j wasn’t an isolated case. In the JavaScript/TypeScript world, nearly all software projects are tethered to **thousands of npm dependencies** – each one a potential security blind spot. Whether it’s a CMS, frontend framework, or DevOps toolchain, your entire stack is built on open source. And while that’s not inherently bad – quite the opposite – it **does** mean you have a responsibility.

### So what does responsible behavior look like?

- **Security budgets** should include the software your business is built on – not just firewalls and pentests.
- **Create visibility**: Which open-source components are in use? Which are critical?
- **Provide financial support**: Sponsorships, public funding, and paid work for maintainers aren’t charity – they’re digital risk management.
- **Build an open-source strategy**: Companies need clear policies for selecting, maintaining, and contributing to open-source software.

In short: if you treat open source as free infrastructure, you’re exploiting your own foundation.

## What Companies Can Do – Right Now

Using open source is easy. Contributing is harder. But it doesn’t take much to start making a difference – and reduce your exposure to fragile infrastructure.

Here’s how to begin:

### 1. **Create Transparency**

Take a hard look in the mirror: what open-source components does your company rely on? Which ones are critical? Tools like Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) can help bring clarity.

### 2. **Take Responsibility**

If a project keeps your business running, you should give back. That doesn’t mean hiring a team. Sometimes it’s enough to report bugs, offer feedback, or lead by example.

### 3. **Yes, Spend Money**

Some projects cost less per month than a single hour of consulting – yet they support millions in business value. Sponsorship, donations, or funding specific improvements are **investments**, not handouts.

### 4. **Make Open Source Part of the Strategy**

Open source isn’t a tool you take off the shelf and put back. Long-term security and efficiency require internal processes, ownership, and shared knowledge.

## Conclusion: Open Source Isn’t a Free Lunch

Open source isn’t magical free software from the internet. It’s infrastructure. It’s shared responsibility. And when properly maintained, it can be one of the most secure foundations a business can have.

**Let’s be honest: without open source, modern software development wouldn’t be financially viable for most companies.** The speed of innovation we all rely on is only possible because we’re standing on the shoulders of thousands of maintainers – most unpaid, often invisible.

That’s why open source needs more than passive consumption:
**Businesses must start thinking, contributing, and funding.**
If you think ignoring it will save you money, you’re cutting costs at the foundation – and you won’t like what happens when the roof caves in.

I publish almost all of my software under free licenses. Not because I’m some idealist, but because I believe robust, sustainable digital systems only happen when everyone helps out.

If you want to know where your business is exposed, what’s critical, and how to take responsible action – **let’s talk. I’ll help you take a closer look.**
