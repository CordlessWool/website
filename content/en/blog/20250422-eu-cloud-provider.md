## Out of the US Cloud – Into Digital Sovereignty?

### 1. Introduction – A Quick Wake-Up Call

**"Why are we still hosting in the US?"**
A question that's often shrugged off – until it suddenly matters.
A new client demands GDPR compliance. An investor asks about the risk posed by the CLOUD Act. Or an internal compliance officer raises concerns. Suddenly the question becomes real: _Do we control our data – or just think we do?_

US cloud providers are omnipresent – but their legal footing in Europe is shaky. The **Privacy Shield is gone**, **Schrems II was a signal**, and the **CLOUD Act** remains a silent risk. Time to leave the comfort zone.

### 2. The Status Quo – Convenient, but Risky

US cloud providers like **Amazon Web Services**, **Microsoft Azure**, or **Google Cloud Platform** are standard in many organizations. They offer a solid technical foundation, a broad service portfolio, and fast, scalable solutions.

But what seems like a strength at first glance can turn into a strategic liability over time:

- **Proprietary services bind you more than you think**
- **Every added integration increases exit costs**
- **Flexibility erodes slowly**

**In short:** US clouds offer many things "as a service" – including dependency.

### 3. The Problem with the US – and Why It Affects Everyone

Reliance on US cloud providers isn't just a technical or economic issue – it has clear legal and political dimensions.

- **Privacy Shield** – struck down by the ECJ in the **"Schrems II"** ruling (2020)
- **EU–US Data Privacy Framework** – in force since 2023, already challenged
- The **CLOUD Act** allows US authorities access to data managed by US companies – even when stored in Europe

**Add to that the political climate:**

- Erosion of privacy protections
- Instability and rapid policy shifts
- Politicization of tech
- Decreasing trust in institutions

**Double uncertainty for European businesses:**

- **Legal** – unstable data transfer frameworks
- **Strategic** – decisions made in Washington impact operations in Frankfurt

**Conclusion:**
Cloud dependency is no longer just a tech choice – it’s a geopolitical one.

### 4. European Alternatives – A Growing Ecosystem

Serious European providers are emerging:

- **Hetzner**, **IONOS Cloud**, **Scaleway**, **STACKIT**, **Cleura**

**Challenges:**

- Fewer features
- Less mature automation
- Limited global scale – which not everyone needs

**Not every business needs worldwide scale.**
Local providers can offer better legal clarity and operational proximity.

**Hybrid strategies** allow global scalability and local compliance where needed.

### What Matters

European cloud infrastructure is maturing. Those who act now can avoid strategic lock-in – and stay compliant in the process.

### 5. Migration: Technically Feasible, Strategically Demanding

Moving to a European cloud takes effort – especially when you're locked into proprietary platforms.

- Tools like **Firebase** or **DynamoDB** are hard to replace
- Alternatives like **Supabase**, **Appwrite**, **MongoDB**, or **ScyllaDB** are more flexible
- Open tools allow **self-hosting and vendor independence**

Even if a managed service isn’t EU-based, **you can always take over the stack** – something AWS doesn’t allow.

**Key migration tasks:**

- Data exports and mapping
- IAM and monitoring decoupling
- Team re-training

### Summary

Migration is a strategic investment – not a technical inconvenience. Independence is built, not bought.

### 6. Why the Effort is Worth It

Why companies make the move anyway:

1. **Control and sovereignty**
2. **Trust and transparency**
3. **Regulatory readiness**
4. **Technical resilience**

**In short:**
European cloud adoption is a long-term bet on sustainability and freedom of choice.

### 7. Conclusion – It’s Not a Cloud Religion

US cloud providers are technically great – but long-term decisions deserve long-term thinking.

**Be conscious. Not just convenient.**

The rules are changing.
Better to know where you stand – and how to act – before you're forced to.

**Need help navigating the shift?**
I support teams technically, strategically, or simply with a clear outside view.
