# From Developer to Manager: Why Technical Excellence Isn't Enough

The story is always the same: An ambitious developer wants to climb the career ladder. They dive deep into code, deliver brilliant solutions, solve the toughest bugs, and have an answer for every technical problem. After years of hard work, their passion pays off – a promotion to team lead is on the table.

What many don't realize: This is where an entirely new game begins. One that becomes even harder because part of them remains trapped in the previous world. Nobody knows the code as well, nobody can solve problems as quickly. So they just keep doing what they've always done.

The problem: People aren't code.

## The Control Reflex: When Developer Thinking Becomes the Problem

Code follows logical structures and is mostly clearly defined: When I press Button A, B happens. With people, it doesn't work that simply. Everyone has their own personality, quirks, and way of thinking. For product development, these differences are gold – for someone used to everything following clear rules, it's a nightmare.

A reflex you can often observe: control, restriction, pressure. Initially, this seems to show improvement, but most people start mentally checking out. Their minds are already at another company. This means:

- Developers contribute less
- Product and codebase quality deteriorates
- Discussions stop happening because nobody cares about the product anymore

Many effects are gradual and barely noticed. Long-term, however, the damage is enormous: The product might be discontinued due to poor quality and rebuilt from scratch – technical debt gets blamed as the reason. But the problem will repeat itself.

**_Case Study:_**
\*A colleague got promoted to manager – a good developer: hardworking, goal-oriented, likeable. But he remains a developer: continues coding and cares more about code than the team. When he notices that time sheets don't match actual hours, he starts controlling and addressing violations. **Otherwise, everything stays the same.** He overlooks that while everyone is physically present, mentally they're elsewhere. Productivity drops, employees quit, **knowledge is lost.\***

_Of course it's bad when employees steal hours. But software development thrives on creative problem-solving and mental focus – not on presence time. He controls instead of leading._

## Motivation, Ownership, Team Dynamics – 3 Success Factors

In principle, it's fine for a manager to occasionally get their hands dirty with code, but team leadership must never suffer, and the position as lead developer and ultimate technical authority must be handed over. The focus must shift to strengthening the factors mentioned in the heading and creating a healthy, trust-based culture:

### Motivation

Presence and participation are gained primarily through enthusiasm and motivation. This isn't about reading every wish from developers' lips, let alone fulfilling them. It's about purpose, success, and appreciation. External benefits help, but they're not the foundation – without the right base, everything else is just band-aid solutions.

### Ownership

Contributing ideas, exploring new possibilities, the desire to create a better product. Ownership, team dynamics, and motivation are closely interconnected. Only when I feel my concerns are heard, move the team forward, and have a positive impact do I actively participate. Ownership therefore also means participation and thus teamwork.

### Team Dynamics

The building block that holds everything together is the team. A good team motivates each other, takes work off each other's plates, shows understanding, and acts as a group. When a team member struggles, a good team automatically catches them. At the same time, everyone commits to the team. Slacking off or delaying deliverables would mean betraying and letting the team down. This creates motivation without drill – through personal discipline, through intrinsic motivation.

Promoting an important team member can throw this balance completely off. Knowledge and experience alone create authority, and in many teams this ensures that mainly experienced team members discuss while juniors hold back. Yet nobody – regardless of experience – is immune to bad decisions, and every objection, no matter how good or bad, can expose weaknesses and sharpen solutions. The promotion creates an additional, artificial authority alongside the natural authority from knowledge and experience. Developers who were used to having to assert themselves now make the final decision and thus decide for the entire team. This might work well initially, but detailed knowledge of implementation details fades as new responsibilities emerge.

## How Do I Measure Team Productivity?

Working hours are easy to measure, but they don't reflect real productivity. Individual productivity is hard to measure anyway, as many factors play a role. A developer who spends all their time helping others can barely be attributed measurable productivity – but without them, others would be significantly less productive.

**The following factors** can only be partially quantified, but reliably indicate team success:

- Discussions are constructive and solution-oriented. Individual participants are willing to compromise for a good overall solution.
- Team members contribute to product improvement by identifying problems and solutions.
- Problems are solved quickly and new features are implemented rapidly.

## Conclusion

Promoting the best developer to team lead isn't fundamentally wrong – but without proper support, it becomes a problem. People aren't code that you can program. Every attempt to optimize teams through control and micromanagement leads to long-term dissatisfaction and hurts productivity.

Real leadership builds on motivation, ownership, and strong team dynamics. This can't be measured in working hours, but shows in how constructively teams solve problems and whether everyone participates in the product's success.

The good news: These problems are solvable. Those willing to view leadership as a new skill that must be learned and developed can successfully grow from developer to manager. It just takes the courage to question old habits and treat people like people – not like code.
