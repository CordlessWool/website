# Increase Team Productivity: Why Structure Matters More Than Focus

Between sprint planning and stakeholder calls, chat messages overflow. The development team needs decisions, customers call about bugs, the boss wants updates. Every interruption seems important - the result: You feel productive, but nothing really gets finished. In the evening, you're exhausted but can't say what you actually accomplished.

## The Multitasking Dilemma

Only 2.5% of people can truly multitask, shows a University of Utah study on attention and performance. Everyone else loses time when switching between tasks. But here's the misconception: The problem isn't interruptions themselves - it's chaotic, uncoordinated interruptions.

Context switching is expensive, but the solution doesn't lie in isolation, but in better structure. Teams that don't exchange information in a coordinated way run in endless loops - everyone working alone, but all missing the target.

As a project manager, you face a particular problem: Everything seems important. The customer is waiting for an answer about the bugfix, the team needs clarification about the next features, the boss wants the current project status.

## Three Ways to More Focus

The problem is real, but not unsolvable. With three proven strategies, you can win back this lost time â€“ without neglecting your team or stakeholders.

### 1. Establish a Real Product Vision

The biggest problem of many projects is that every department has its own "vision." The sales team wants more revenue, the development team wants clean code, the support team wants fewer tickets. The consequence: You're constantly translating between different goals and become the central bottleneck.

A real product vision is different. It shows the big picture and gives all participants a common direction. It's not detailed, but directional. When everyone has the same goal in mind, project participants can decide beforehand what fits the vision and what doesn't. A large portion of follow-up questions disappears as a result.

The effect for you: Instead of constant discussions about priorities, you have a clear filter for decisions. Features, bugs, and requests can be evaluated more easily when everyone knows where the journey is heading.

### 2. Distribute Expertise and Create Team Autonomy

Many project managers unwittingly become the central node for all decisions. Every question lands with you, every problem gets escalated. The team develops a dependency that makes you the bottleneck.

The solution lies in distributing expertise. UX experts can help develop a well-founded product vision through user research and support insights and substantiate decisions to stakeholders. Tech leads make technical decisions, and the team can act independently within clear boundaries. Your role transforms from sole decision-maker to strategic leader who creates frameworks and only intervenes in real conflicts.

The key is giving the team decision-making frameworks: Clear boundaries within which they can act themselves. Less escalation means fewer interruptions for you and more autonomy for the team.

### 3. Make Conflicts Transparent

The most difficult problem for project managers: All stakeholders present their requests as "highest priority." The boss wants the new feature, the sales team needs the bugfix, the customer expects the integration. You stand in the middle and somehow have to satisfy everyone.

The solution doesn't lie in agreeing with everyone or prioritizing yourself. Instead, you make the conflicts visible. When two stakeholders both demand "highest priority," you bring them together and let them decide themselves. You switch from the villain who says "no" to the moderator who shows realities.

The effect: Stakeholders suddenly understand the complexity of your position and bombard you less with unrealistic requests. At the same time, they develop a better understanding of the team's limited resources.
