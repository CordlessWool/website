With experience in software development, project management, and operations, I bridge the gap between business goals and technical execution. I work closely with stakeholders, developers, and product teams to turn abstract goals into concrete results. When timelines are tight or teams need support, I can step in hands-on to keep things moving and ensure operational continuity.
