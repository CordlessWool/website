However, it is not the most suitable for this task. Server-side file handling is a necessity, and JavaScript has a place there. However, the sheer number of file types and storage systems, such as S3, FTP, Markdown, JSON, and YML, can be overwhelming.</p>
<p>This is precisely where Loom-IO excels, providing a solution that makes it easier to read different files from different locations with the same syntax. By adding adapters and converters, users can streamline their file handling processes.</p>
