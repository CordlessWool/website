However, I have reservations about entrusting these systems to third-party companies. I have connected various devices with Node-RED to obtain real-time data on my location, adjust the volume of a Sonos speaker, and control the temperature of my home.</p>
<p>To further enhance my automation capabilities, I have also started leveraging OCR technology to extract information from documents and organize them in folders on my Nextcloud instance. Due to the suboptimal quality of the OCR, I have chosen to defer further action until the technology improves. Consequently, the current state of affairs is that there is only a Webdave plugin for Node-RED.</p>
