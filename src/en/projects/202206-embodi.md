Even before the official release, I made my first attempts with SvelteKit because I was already enthusiastic about Svelte. SvelteKit opened up new, simple possibilities for software development in a modern way. Since building a simple website seemed too undemanding to me, I started developing a static site generator. The first version had problems, particularly in the area of rendering, especially when rendering images in different sizes and formats. I then developed a second version, which currently still concentrates on generating pages based on JSON and, unlike the first version, does not offer an interface. Unfortunately, this version still has some weaknesses in terms of complexity that need to be fixed. My goal is to make the handling and development of templates as simple as possible. For this reason, I am already working on a third version, which benefits from my experience with the previous versions and takes a completely new approach. The aim is to make it easier to get started and develop templates so that even inexperienced developers can have a good experience with the library.

The first version is still available on [Github](https://gitlab.com/CordlessWool/vally) and was developed under the working title Vally.
