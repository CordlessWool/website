It is impossible how complicated it could be to find a kindergarten place. So I wanted to make this easier and started to develop a platform. At some point, I noticed that the government of Berlin itself also implemented something similar. I tried to connect to this and talked to those responsible and get a talk. Because of the restriction they made and the requirement that the kindergartens in berlin have to use their system, I stopped investing time in it, and finding and connect to a kindergarten stays complicate.
