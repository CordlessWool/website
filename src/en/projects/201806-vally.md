In 2018, I joined forces with another founder to establish a new company with the goal of developing machines compatible with the Industrie 4.0 standard. I was clear from the outset about my intentions, but we encountered significant difficulties.

The outcome of this venture is a theme for EnduroJS, a small, user-friendly content management system (CMS) designed for one-page company websites. I have named it Vally.
