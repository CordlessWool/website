In the age of 15th I started to write short stories and I am still doing it form time to time. For a long time the just stored on my pc, but people I show them, liked them, so I published them with GhostJS. Loom was my first own developed theme for GhostJS. It isn't updated anymore because I started a new Version based on Gridsome that use the GhostJS API (Loom 2.0). At least also this is not up to date anymore and was replaced.
