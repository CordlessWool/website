2018 I started to make my life easier and energy-efficient with home automation, but I don't want to trust companies. I connected different devices with Node-RED to get the information if I am at home, turn on or off a Sonos speaker, and my heater up or down.

To go one step further, I started to get information from documents via OCR to rename and sort them in folders on my Nextcloud instance. Because of the low quality of the OCR, I decide to wait until it will be improved. As a result, there currently only stays a Webdave plugin for Node-RED
