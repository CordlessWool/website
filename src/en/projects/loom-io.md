Started as browser language JavaScript is not the first to think about file handling and access them, but not at least images need to be handled on the server side, where JavaScript definitely found its place. Anyways could file handling be annoying, because there are so many file types and storing systems like s3, ftp, markdown, json, yml, to just some some of them.

Exactly this is where loom-io get in place and is developed for, to make it easier to read different files from different locations with the same syntax, just by adding adapters and converter.
