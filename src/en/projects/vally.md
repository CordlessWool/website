2018 I joined another founder. We wanted to start with him a new company to make machines ready for Industrie 4.0. I made my state clear from the beginning, but we get in unsolve able dissent.

What stays is a theme for EnduroJS, a small, easy to use CMS system for a one-pager company website. I called it Vally.
