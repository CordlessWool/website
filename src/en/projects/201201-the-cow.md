The concept behind "Die Kuh bringt's" was to create an online shop for food directly from the farmer, bypassing the need for intermediaries. The car should have a cow-inspired design.
This was my first significant project, and I was on the verge of launching it when my partner left the project shortly before. I was then required to complete a mandatory internship and bachelor thesis.
In addition to acquiring the skills required to structure a large-scale software development project, I also gained expertise in the process of establishing a company, including the creation of a market research report and business plan.
