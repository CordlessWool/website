A computer is an excellent tool for easily and affordably starting new ideas. Although the actual implementation can be more challenging than anticipated, a prototype can be created quickly. Over the past 15 years of developing software, I have accumulated a wealth of experience that virtually sets no limits on my project executions. However, I have developed a particular expertise in the **JavaScript/TypeScript environment**. Despite having studied computer engineering and enjoyed writing assembly code, this feels miles away from my origins. I benefit from experiences across various fields, each with its pros and cons. Since I also find hardware programming fascinating, I would welcome project inquiries in this area, although my primary focus will likely remain on JavaScript/TypeScript.

The flexibility of my freelance career allows me to continuously expand my knowledge by working on many of my own projects, never standing still. This is something which seems nearly impossible with all the new and exciting developments in the field. My ability to consider problems on a larger scale allows me to view projects not only with a focus on clean and efficient code but also with the aim of creating an excellent product. This attribute led me to spend several years as a technical project manager, though I always kept hands-on with coding.

I would be delighted to collaborate on a project in the JavaScript/TypeScript sphere, whether it's for an open-source initiative or through my **freelance work**. I am always eager to tackle new challenges, so please bring me your problems.
