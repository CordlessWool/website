A computer is an excellent tool for easily and affordably starting new ideas. Although the actual implementation can turn out to be more challenging than anticipated, a prototype can quickly be created. Over the past 15 years of developing software, I have accumulated a wealth of experience that virtually sets no limits on my project executions. Yet, the **JavaScript/TypeScript environment** has become my predominant area of expertise. Despite having studied computer engineering and enjoyed writing assembly code, this feels miles away from my origins. Ultimately, I benefit from experiences across various fields, each with its pros and cons. Since I also find hardware programming fascinating, I would welcome project inquiries in this area, although my primary focus will likely remain on JavaScript/TypeScript.

Thanks to the flexibility my freelance career provides, I am able to continuously expand my knowledge by working on many of my own projects, never standing stillâ€”something which seems nearly impossible with all the new and exciting developments in the field. My ability to consider problems on a larger scale allows me to view projects not only with a focus on clean and efficient code but also with the aim of creating an excellent product. This attribute led me to spend several years as a technical project manager, though I always kept hands-on with coding.

I would be delighted to collaborate on a project in the JavaScript/TypeScript sphere, whether it's for an open-source initiative or through my **freelance work**. I am always eager to tackle new challenges, so bring me your problems!

I prioritize **open-source, SvelteKit, or projects with significant general value.**
